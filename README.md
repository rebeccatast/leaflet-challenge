# USGS Leaflet Challenge
Using data accessed from the USGS related to all earthquakes fromt the past day (earthquakes.geojson or [all earthquakes from the past day](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/1.0_day.geojson)) I used Leaflet to plot all of the earthquakes in the dataset. The map of earthquakes contains a data marker for each earthquake, reflecting both magnitude of the earthquake and the depth of the earthquake. The size or radius of the circle demonstrates the magnitude, while the color of the circle demonstrates the depth. Each data marker contains a popup that includes the location, magnitude, and depth of each earthquake. There is also a color coded legend providing more information about color and depth.
